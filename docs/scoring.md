Completed on Day 3, after the seal reveal. Results are reported honestly, misses included.

## Seal verification

Method: SHA-256 of every file under `sealed/`, sorted by path, one line per file
(`shasum -a 256` format), committed as `SEAL.sha256` on Day 1. On Day 3, rerun
the same command and diff against the committed file.
